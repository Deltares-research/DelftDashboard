APPENDIX I: Description of Pre-Release Software


FLOODADAPT MODEL-BUILDER
The FloodAdapt model-builder software contains two model builders: a Delft-FIAT model builder and a SFINCS model builder. It supports users in rapidly creating Delft-FIAT and SFINCS models, which are key components of a FloodAdapt system.

INTENDED USES OF THE FLOODADAPT MODEL-BUILDER
FloodAdapt is intended to help users get started building a baseline SFINCS and Delft-FIAT model to facilitate the setup of a FloodAdapt system in a new location. These models can be modified and run interactively through a FloodAdapt system. 

FloodAdapt – through its use of SFINCS and Delft-FIAT – allows users to create flood and impact maps for different what-if scenarios. The SFINCS and Delft-FIAT models created with the model-builders can be improved through calibration, validation, and interaction with the local or regional agencies who are using and evaluating FloodAdapt. The accuracy of the SFINCS and Delft-FIAT models will depend on the accuracy of the input data. The FloodAdapt model-builder contains some connections to open-source data for the building of models but provides no guarantee on the correctness of this data. Users should always take care to evaluate the accuracy of the models through validation and to update data sources accordingly. Evaluating historic events in FloodAdapt can help illuminate which data may need improvement and should be collected when resources allow.

The use of SFINCS and Delft-FIAT models through FloodAdapt is not intended for detailed engineering design of adaptation measures. Once these models, through their use via FloodAdapt, have helped the community identify strategies and priority areas for improvements, the specific design requirements for these strategies should be done using more comprehensive modeling tools and accurate data sources.  

QUALITY OF MODEL OUTPUT
The quality of SFINCS and Delft-FIAT model output is directly related to the quality of the input data. When input data are coarse or uncertain, these models can still provide a meaningful understanding of trends in flooding and impacts under future conditions, identify areas of priority for adaptation, and explore the effectiveness of different adaptation strategies. However, it is important when setting up a FloodAdapt system for users to test the underlying models and to clearly communicate the level of accuracy end-users can expect when using FloodAdapt to support conceptual adaptation planning.
