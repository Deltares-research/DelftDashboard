## Welcome to the FloodAdapt Model Builder setup!

# Before you start, please ensure that your folder structure is as follows:
   (notation: <example1> is a directory, example2.any is a file)
   
   <YOUR-ROOT>
      - <_internal>
      - <userFiles>     <--- Paste Data.zip here
      - FloodAdapt_ModelBuilder.exe
      - Instructions_to_run_Modelbuilders.txt
      - setup.bat

# Deltares provides:
      Data.zip: This file contains all the necessary data for the model. 
      Paste it as a .zip file into <userFiles> (setup.bat will unzip it!)

# Running the modelbuilder for the first time:
      Paste 'Data.zip' into the <userFiles> directory
      double click 'setup.bat'

After completing setup.bat once, you can run FloodAdapt_ModelBuilder.exe by double clicking
