Welcome to the FloodAdapt Model Builder setup!

Before you start, please ensure that your folder structure is as follows:

<YOUR-ROOT>
   - FloodAdapt_ModelBuilder.exe
   - <_internal>
   - setup.bat
   - <userFiles>
   - INSTRUCTIONS_PLEASE_READ.txt
(notation: <example1> is a directory, example2.any is a file)

The <userFiles> directory is where you should place your files.
The following files are required:

Deltares provides:
1. Data.zip: This file contains all the necessary data for the model. 
	Paste it as a .zip file into <userFiles> (the setup will unzip it!)

You should provide:
1. mapbox_token.txt: This file should contain your Mapbox token. 
	create an account at: https://www.mapbox.com/
	generate a personal token
	Copy the token to <userFiles>/mapbox_token.txt

2. census_key.txt: This file should contain your Census key.
	go to: https://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html
	enter your company name and email adress
	Copy the token to <userFiles>/census_key.txt

Your folder structure should look like this now:
<YOUR-ROOT>
   - FloodAdapt_ModelBuilder.exe
   - <_internal>
   - setup.bat
   - <userFiles>
	- mapbox_token.txt
	- census_key.txt
	- Data.zip
   - Instructions_to_run_Modelbuilders.txt

Once you have placed all the necessary files in the <userFiles> directory, you can run the setup by double-clicking on the 'setup.bat' file.
This will run a script that will initialize your setup. 

Once setup has completed succesfully, you can run the FloodAdapt Model Builder by double-clicking on the 'FloodAdapt_ModelBuilder.exe' file.
